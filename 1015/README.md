### ðŸ§  Problem Summary
This problem requires calculating the distance between two points in a 2D plane. You are given the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:  
`distance = âˆš((x2 - x1)Â² + (y2 - y1)Â²)`

The result should be displayed with 4 decimal places.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- How to calculate the distance between two points using the Euclidean formula.
- Using `Math.pow()` and `Math.sqrt()` in JavaScript for mathematical calculations.
- Properly formatting the result to 4 decimal places using `.toFixed(4)`.
